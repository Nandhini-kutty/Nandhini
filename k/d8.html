1.Kadai Paneer is a popular paneer recipe where paneer and bell peppers are cooked in a spicy masala.
2.It is one of the most popular paneer recipes. It’s there on the menu in almost all Indian restaurants. I remember always ordering it when we ate out.

Kadai is a like a wok commonly used in Indian cooking. 
3.We use it to make stir fry and all sorts of things. We also use it for deep frying snacks and sweets.

4.This dish is called Kadai Paneer because it’s cooked in a kadai. But if you don’t have a kadai you can simply use a wok or any other pan. I actually did not make it in a kadai!
