1. Methi leaves or fenugreek leaves are very nutritious.
2. It is full of Iron and so one should include it in their diet at least once a week. 
3.I know plucking the leaves and cleaning it very tedious job.
4.So I usually do this task while watching TV or movie and if you get some more hands to help, that’s perfect.
5.Alternately you can use frozen methi leaves instead of fresh leaves.
6.If your methi is too bitter or you do not like bitter taste, I have 
already mentioned the trick to get rid of methi leaves in the instructions. 
7.You have seen many methi recipes on the blog and so you might know that I love methi leaves, and of course dear hubby too.
